# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Balance Nutrition: AI-Powered Mentor LMS

### 1. Executive Summary
The **Balance Nutrition Mentor LMS** is a next-generation training platform designed to transform the onboarding and continuous education of clinical mentors. Unlike traditional static LMSs, this platform leverages **Groq Llama 3.3 70B** to generate dynamic, context-aware assessments, simulated clinical scenarios, and automated performance audits. The goal is to ensure every mentor is "Review Ready" through rigorous, adaptive testing rather than passive content consumption.

### 2. Objectives & Goals
- **Eliminate Rote Learning:** Replace static question banks with AI-generated assessments that test understanding at multiple cognitive levels (Recall, Application, Analysis).
- **Scale Training:** Remove the bottleneck of HR manually grading assignments and writing tests.
- **Clinical Excellence:** Ensure mentors master the specific "Balance Nutrition" protocols, pricing, and clinical logic before handling real clients.
- **Real-Time Founder Oversight:** Provide Khyati Ma'am and the leadership team with a "God Mode" view of mentor competency, confidence, and engagement.

### 3. User Personas

- **Needs:** Interactive content, instant feedback on quizzes, realistic practice.

#### B. The Founder (Super Admin)
- **Goal:** Verify that mentors truly understand the brand vision and clinical protocols.
- **Pain Points:** Cannot manually vet every mentor; needs high-level assurance of quality.
